    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Benjamin Kotwall, and I am currently a Software Engineering student enrolled at Florida Gulf Coast University.  I was originally born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and lived there until I was about ten years old.  I then moved, with my family, to Wilmington, North Carolina, where I grew up.  So, I am a dual citizen of both Canda and the United States.  I attended both Middle and High School in North Carolina.  I also attended the University of North Carolina, where I earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology, while playing Divison I Varsity Men's Tennis at the same time.</p>
    
    <p>After graduating with my Biology Degree, I decided to pursue another degree, and I attended Davidson County Community College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  In 2010, I graduated with an Associate of Science Degree in Histotechnology.  Histology is a part of Pathology, which is a field of Medicine that deals with the diagnoses of diseases.  I then moved to Fort Myers, Florida where I got my first job working in Histology/Pathology for Lee Health at Gulf Coast Medical Center.  However, after working for two years, I decided that Histology was not my passion, and that I did not want to spend the rest of my life working in the Laboratory.  Once again, I made the decision to go back to school.  This is my first semester here at Florida Gulf Coast University, and I am excited to be here, and be a part of the Software Engineering Program.  I am really enjoying everything that I am learning, and I am looking forward to all the future opportunities that will be available to me.  In addition to being a "forever student," my other hobbies include playing and watching tennis, traveling, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends.</p>
