    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Benjamin Kotwall, and I am currently a Software Engineering student enrolled at Florida Gulf Coast University.  I was originally born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and lived there until I was about ten years old.  I then moved, with my family, to Wilmington, North Carolina, where I grew up.  So, I am a dual citizen of both Canda and the United States.  I attended both Middle and High School in North Carolina.  I also attended the University of North Carolina, where I earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology, while playing Divison I Varsity Men's Tennis at the same time.</p>
    
    <p>After graduating with my Biology Degree, I decided to pursue another degree, and I attended Davidson County Community College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  In 2010, I graduated with an Associate of Science Degree in Histotechnology.  Histology is a part of Pathology, which is a field of Medicine that deals with the diagnoses of diseases.
